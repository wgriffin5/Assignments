<p> You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So we don't get dessert? Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? Daddy horny, Michael. Douche chill! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist.

For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. Fun and failure both start out the same way. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet.

We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter? How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON.
