# Rules:

#     Must use at least two classes
#     Must have at least 4 horses (All horses can NOT be different classes!
#     User input must affect at least one horse's speed
#     Must out put the horses' paths (even as simple as "---'horse 1'") as race progresses
#     Goals: classes, methods, passing arguments to methods, thinking about the design and how classes interface with each other, DRYness, making a complete & interesting & good program

# set a finish
# creat a cheat for 1 horse
# movement impetus/user input
# show movement
# shows horses 
# course also a class
